Subject: Quick website preview for Gilbert Plumbing (built for more calls)

Hi there,

I'm Michael (local web builder). I put together a no-cost preview page for Gilbert Plumbing Services you can look at here:

https://michael-preview-gilbert-plumbing.vercel.app

I based it on your current site, but tightened it around conversion on mobile:
- Call CTA is immediate (and stays easy to reach)
- Cleaner service overview (scan-friendly)
- Trust section upfront (licensed/bonded/insured + experience)
- Simple request form flow (wired to email/text/CRM in the live version)
- Real project photos (to show proof fast)

If you want me to tailor it, reply "YES" with:
- Best email/phone for incoming leads
- Your hours (I saw Mon-Fri 7am-6pm; Sat-Sun closed on your site, but want to confirm)
- Whether you want the primary CTA to be Call vs Text
- 3 additional project photos (if you have them) + 3 reviews you want featured

If you like the preview and want it live, it's $500 to launch the initial site (publish + basic setup). No obligation until you approve the preview.

Thanks,
Michael
